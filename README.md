A website where you can explore the campgrounds all over the world, posted by different users. CRUD operations can be performed on each campground and each comment related to it. Involves intermediate CSS and JavaScript. Database has been integrated with MongoDB Atlas. Also includes basic authentication and authorization processes. Although it's not a fully-fledged commercial website for campgrounds, but it can be scaled upto a really good professional level website. Looks better on desktop or laptop.
